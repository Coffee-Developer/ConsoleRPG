# ConsoleRPG

## A text-based console game.

This is a simple console RPG made in C # (Csharp), well, it's simple, but it has some "funny" features like:
 - Infinite combat system.
 - Market (where if you sell an item, the sold item will be allocated to the seller's inventory and vice-versa).
 - Elaborate level system.
 - Difficulty system that changes gameplay.
 - And other things.
